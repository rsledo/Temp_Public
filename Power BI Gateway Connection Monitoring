Power BI Gateway Connection Monitoring and Re-activation Guide
Introduction
Power BI gateways enable secure data transfer between on-premises data sources and Power BI services. Sometimes, a gateway may go offline, resulting in failures of dataset refreshes or dataflows. This guide helps users identify when a Power BI gateway connection is offline and how to bring it back online, including when to contact the TOC team and how to reactivate Power Automate processes.

1. Identifying an Offline Gateway <a name="identifying-an-offline-gateway"></a>
1.1. Signs of an Offline Gateway
If a gateway is offline, the following issues may occur:
* Dataset Refresh Failures.
* Gateway Status Alerts.
* Failed Power Automate Jobs.
1.2. Checking Gateway Status in Power BI Service
1. Sign in to Power BI Service.
2. Navigate to Settings.
3. Go to Manage Gateways.
4. Check Gateway Status (Offline or Online).

2. Reactivating a Gateway <a name="reactivating-a-gateway"></a>
2.1. Restarting the Gateway Service
Follow these steps to restart the gateway service:
1. Access the gateway machine.
2. Open Windows Services (services.msc).
3. Find the Power BI Gateway Service and restart it.
4. Verify in Power BI if the gateway is back online.
2.2. Re-authenticating Gateway in Power BI
1. Go to Manage Gateways in Power BI.
2. Select the offline gateway.
3. Re-authenticate by entering the required credentials.
2.3. Updating Gateway Credentials
1. Go to Data Source Settings.
2. Update credentials for each data source.
3. Verify connectivity.

3. Contacting the TOC Team <a name="contacting-the-toc-team"></a>
If the Power BI gateway remains offline after restarting the service or updating credentials, you should contact the TOC Team to investigate and start the gateway if required.
* TOC Team Contact Information:
    * Email: toc-support@yourcompany.com
    * Phone: +1 (123) 456-7890
    * Ticket System: Submit a support ticket via Internal Support System

4. Power Automate Process Re-activation <a name="power-automate-process-re-activation"></a>
Once the gateway comes back online, you may need to ensure that any Power Automate processes that depend on the gateway are reactivated.
Steps to Reactivate Power Automate Jobs:
1. Open Power Automate:
    * Go to Power Automate and sign in.
2. Go to My Flows:
    * Navigate to My Flows in the Power Automate dashboard.
3. Check for Failed Flows:
    * Identify any flows that failed due to the gateway being offline.
    * These flows will show a "Failed" status under the Run History.
4. Restart Failed Flows:
    * Click on the failed flow.
    * Choose Resubmit to rerun the flow once the gateway is online.
5. Verify Flow Run:
    * Ensure that the flow executes successfully after re-submitting.
    * Check any notifications or outputs generated by the flow.
6. Enable Scheduled Flows (if disabled):
    * If any flows were paused or disabled due to the gateway outage, re-enable them by toggling the flow's status to On.

5.1. Updating Semantic Models
Semantic models represent the data models that drive reports and dashboards in Power BI.

Open the Dataset:

Go to Power BI Service.
In the workspace, locate the dataset connected to the semantic model.
Update Dataset Credentials:

Click on the Settings (gear icon) for the dataset.
Under the Data source credentials section, update the credentials for the data sources associated with the semantic model.
Re-enter connection details (database, username, password) if necessary.
Test Dataset Refresh:

Manually trigger a refresh by clicking on Refresh Now.
Monitor the Refresh History to confirm successful refresh without errors.
Enable Scheduled Refresh:

If disabled, ensure that the Scheduled Refresh option is re-enabled, so the dataset refreshes automatically based on the defined schedule.
5.2. Updating Dataflows
Dataflows enable self-service ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) for data preparation in Power BI.

Go to Dataflows:

In the Power BI workspace, navigate to the Dataflows tab.
Edit Dataflow Settings:

Select the dataflow that relies on the on-premises gateway.
In the dataflow editor, click on Settings (gear icon).
Update Gateway Connection:

Under Gateway Connection, ensure the appropriate on-premises data gateway is selected and shows an Online status.
If necessary, update the Data source credentials used by the dataflow.
Refresh Dataflow:

After updating credentials and ensuring the gateway is online, click on Refresh Now to test the dataflow.
Monitor the Refresh History to confirm the dataflow runs without errors.
Enable Scheduled Refresh:

Ensure that scheduled refresh is enabled for the dataflow if it was previously paused.

5. Additional Troubleshooting Steps <a name="additional-troubleshooting-steps"></a>
If the gateway remains offline after following the steps above, consider these additional troubleshooting steps:
* Check Network Connectivity.
* Update Gateway Software.
* Review Gateway Logs.

Conclusion
By following these steps, users can identify when a Power BI gateway is offline, take steps to reactivate it, contact the TOC team if necessary, and ensure that Power Automate processes depending on the gateway are properly reactivated.
