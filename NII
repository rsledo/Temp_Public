General Idea

The Power BI Data Model provides detailed information on various accrual components, interest-bearing balances (IBB), rates, and dimensions. The goal is to facilitate analysis and reporting for end users by structuring data into well-defined measures and dimensions.

The model consists of the following key areas:

Accrual Measures: Various calculations related to accrual amounts in different timeframes and comparisons.

IBB Measures: Interest-bearing balance data.

Rate Measures: Includes exchange rates and reference rate fixings.

Dimensions: Includes account-related attributes, accrual types, dates, and other relevant metadata.

Approach

Structuring the Data Model

The data model has been structured to provide a comprehensive view of accruals, interest-bearing balances, and associated rates.

Each measure and dimension is categorized to allow efficient reporting and analysis.

Data Categorization

Account-related attributes are mapped in the Account dimension.

Accrual-related details are grouped under Accrual dimensions.

Date references and financial periods are stored in the Date dimension.

Supporting metadata such as currency and firm identifiers are captured in the Other category.

Usage in Reporting

Measures can be used in reports to analyze trends, compare accruals over different periods, and identify financial patterns.

Dimensions help filter and slice the data to focus on specific accounts, segments, or entities.

Rates provide conversion factors for financial calculations involving multiple currencies.
