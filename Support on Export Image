Subject: Assistance Needed: Enable "Export Report to Image" in Power BI Workspace

Hi Team,

I am working on a Power Automate flow that requires exporting a Power BI report to a PNG file. However, I am encountering the following error:
“Export report to image is disabled on tenant level.”

Since I don’t have access to the admin portal, I’d like to ask for guidance on how to get this feature activated specifically for my workspace ([Workspace Name]).

Could someone with the necessary permissions or expertise please let me know the steps to enable this feature at the tenant or workspace level? Or, if it's a restricted feature, let me know how I can request access through the proper channels.

Thank you for your support!

Best regards,
