1. Dataflows
Description: Dataflows are ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes that allow data preparation outside of datasets.
What to change: Ownership and connections used in dataflows.
Steps:
Transfer Ownership: Open the workspace, go to the Dataflows tab, select the dataflow, and update the owner.
Connection Credentials: Make sure to update credentials used for any linked services (databases, APIs, etc.).
2. Datasets (Semantic Layer)
Description: Datasets represent the semantic layer in Power BI, including data models and measures.
What to change: Dataset refresh credentials.
Steps:
Go to the Settings of the dataset.
Under the Scheduled Refresh tab, update the credentials for all data sources.
Check RLS (Row-Level Security) settings if the new user will manage different permissions.
3. Gateways
Description: On-premises data gateways allow Power BI to access on-premises data securely.
What to change: Update gateway ownership and data source credentials.
Steps:
In the Power BI Service, go to Manage Gateways.
Add the new user as an admin for the relevant gateway.
For each data source connected through the gateway, update the credentials under the Data Source Settings.
4. Email Subscriptions
Description: Email subscriptions are scheduled email reports sent automatically to users.
What to change: Transfer ownership of subscriptions.
Steps:
Subscriptions are user-specific. The new user needs to manually recreate these subscriptions for any reports or dashboards.
Ensure the new user has appropriate access to the reports or dashboards to set up subscriptions.
5. Power Automate Flows
Description: Power Automate flows allow automated processes, such as sending Power BI reports via email or automating data refreshes.
What to change: Update ownership and connections.
Steps:
Open Power Automate and go to My Flows.
For each flow, reassign ownership (if shared) or export the flow and import it under the new user’s account.
Ensure that all connections (e.g., Power BI, Outlook, SQL) used in the flow are updated to use the new user’s credentials.
6. Alert Rules
Description: Data-driven alerts are used to notify users when certain conditions are met in a dashboard.
What to change: Alerts are user-specific and cannot be transferred.
Steps:
The new user needs to manually recreate alerts on the dashboards they have access to.
Ensure the new user is granted the necessary permissions to the underlying datasets and reports.
7. Workspace Ownership and Permissions
Description: Workspaces are shared environments where reports, datasets, and dataflows are managed.
What to change: Update workspace ownership and permissions.
Steps:
Navigate to the Workspace settings in Power BI Service.
Update the Admin Role for the workspace to assign the new user as an admin.
Review and modify permissions for each member as needed.
8. Dashboard and Report Sharing
Description: Reports and dashboards can be shared with other users.
What to change: Reassign shared content.
Steps:
The new user will need to reshare any dashboards and reports manually, as shared content is user-specific.
Ensure the new user has appropriate access to the underlying datasets.
9. Scheduled Data Refreshes
Description: Reports and datasets often have scheduled refreshes to keep data up-to-date.
What to change: Update refresh credentials for all datasets.
Steps:
Go to the Settings of each dataset in the Power BI Service.
Update credentials under the Scheduled Refresh tab for all data sources.
Check if any datasets are connected through on-premises data gateways and update those credentials as well.
10. Power BI Embedded (if applicable)
Description: Power BI Embedded allows Power BI reports to be integrated into applications.
What to change: Update service principal and API access.
Steps:
Ensure the new user has appropriate access to the Azure Active Directory (AAD) app registration used for Power BI Embedded.
Update credentials and API tokens where necessary.
11. App Ownership
Description: Published Power BI apps can be shared across users in an organization.
What to change: Ownership and publishing of apps.
Steps:
The new user needs to manually publish or republish any Power BI apps.
Transfer workspace ownership if the app is linked to a workspace.
12. Power BI Service Account (if applicable)
Description: If a service account (or organizational account) is used for Power BI tasks.
What to change: Update credentials for any data sources, gateways, and Power BI Services linked to this account.
Steps:
Check for all services linked to the Power BI service account and update credentials as necessary.
Steps Overview
Dataflows: Transfer ownership and update connection credentials.
Datasets: Update refresh credentials and permissions (e.g., RLS).
Gateways: Update gateway ownership and data source credentials.
Email Subscriptions: New user needs to recreate subscriptions manually.
Power Automate: Reassign ownership of flows or recreate them under the new account.
Alerts: New user must recreate data alerts manually.
Workspaces: Transfer workspace admin role to the new user.
Dashboard and Report Sharing: Manually re-share reports and dashboards under the new user.
Scheduled Data Refreshes: Update all data source credentials.
Power BI Embedded: Update service principal and API tokens (if applicable).
App Ownership: The new user must republish apps.
Service Account: Update credentials for data sources and services linked to the service account.
