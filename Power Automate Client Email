To send a Power BI report filtered by client to each individual client using Power Automate, you'll need to set up a process that leverages Power Automate to dynamically filter the report and then send it to each client via email.
Here are the detailed steps to accomplish this:
Prerequisites
1. A Power BI report with a client filter (e.g., a slicer or page filter by client).
2. A Power Automate subscription or access to Microsoft Power Automate.
3. Permissions to use Power BI’s export API or subscribe to reports in Power Automate.
Steps
Step 1: Create the Report with the Client Filter
Ensure that your report has a page filter or slicer for clients. You should be able to filter the report based on individual clients. For example, in the report page, you have a Client Name filter.
Step 2: Set up a Table of Clients with Emails (Optional)
If you don’t already have a list of clients with their corresponding emails, you should create a simple table or data source (e.g., an Excel file, SQL database, or SharePoint list) that lists all clients and their associated email addresses.
Example structure:
Client Name	Email
Client A	clienta@example.com
Client B	clientb@example.com
Client C	clientc@example.com
Step 3: Open Power Automate
1. Sign in to Power Automate.
2. Select Create on the left navigation panel and choose Automated Flow.
Step 4: Create a New Flow
1. Choose a Trigger:
    * Select a trigger to start the flow. For example, you can choose Recurrence to schedule the report to be sent periodically (e.g., daily or weekly).
    * Define the recurrence (e.g., every week).
Step 5: Add a "List of Clients" Action (Optional)
If you're using a table or a list of clients:
1. Add a New Action and select Get Rows (for Excel or SharePoint) or Get Items (for a SharePoint list).
    * This will retrieve the list of clients and their corresponding email addresses.
Step 6: Add the Power BI "Export to File" Action
1. Add a New Action in your flow.
2. Search for Power BI and choose the Export to File for Power BI Reports action.
3. Configure the following parameters:
    * Workspace: Select the Power BI workspace where your report is located.
    * Report: Choose the report you want to export.
    * Export Format: Choose either PDF or Excel, depending on your preference.
    * Pages: Select the pages of the report you want to include.
4. Filter the Report by Client:
    * In the "Export to File" action, under Filter, add a filter query for the client field.
    * Example: "Client Name eq 'Client A'".
        * The syntax may depend on the actual name of your client column in Power BI.
        * This dynamically filters the report based on the client.
5. If using a list of clients from a data source, insert a dynamic content variable (e.g., from the list of clients in Excel or SharePoint) into the filter query so that the flow runs for each client individually.
Step 7: Add an "Email" Action
1. After exporting the filtered report, add another action to send the report via email.
2. Search for Outlook or Gmail and choose Send an Email (V2).
3. Configure the email action:
    * To: Use the dynamic content field to insert the client's email address (if using a client list).
    * Subject: Enter the subject of the email (e.g., "Your Weekly Report").
    * Body: Write the body of the email.
    * Attachment: Add the exported Power BI file (PDF or Excel) as an attachment from the previous Export to File step.
Step 8: Loop Through the Clients (If Needed)
If you're sending the report to multiple clients, use a Loop to iterate through each client in your list:
1. Add a "Apply to Each" loop to process each client.
2. Inside the loop, use the Export to File and Send Email actions, and dynamically replace the client and email for each iteration.
Step 9: Test the Flow
1. Save the flow.
2. Test it manually by running the flow and checking if the report gets filtered correctly for each client and emailed.
Step 10: Monitor and Maintain
* Monitor the Flow: After the flow runs, you can monitor the success or failure of each run from the Run History in Power Automate.
* Adjust the Schedule: If necessary, adjust the flow recurrence to fit your needs.

Example Flow Summary
1. Trigger: Flow starts on a schedule (e.g., weekly).
2. Get Clients (Optional): Retrieve a list of clients and their email addresses from a table.
3. Export Power BI Report: Filter the report by client using a dynamic filter and export it.
4. Send Email: Attach the exported report and send it to the corresponding client.
5. Loop: If using a list of clients, loop through each client to repeat the process.
