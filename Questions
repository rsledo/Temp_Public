Subject: Connecting Power BI to PROD Environment Using Existing Service Principal

Message:

Hi Team,

We are in the process of connecting Power BI to the PROD environment and, as per company policy, we donâ€™t have access to the username and password for the technical account. However, we already have a service principal in place that has access to all the required services in Power BI PROD.

Could someone guide me on the best approach to configure Power BI to use the existing service principal for authentication in this scenario? Any tips on ensuring a smooth and secure connection would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Subject: Best Approach for Connecting Power BI to PROD Environment Without User Credentials

Message:

Hi Team,

We are working on connecting Power BI to the PROD environment using a technical account, but due to company policies, we do not have direct access to the username and password for this account.

To comply with security protocols while enabling access, I would like to propose using a service principal to manage the connection without needing user credentials. This would allow us to securely authenticate via Azure Active Directory (AAD) and follow best practices for managing access in a production environment.

Could someone from the team please assist with setting up a service principal for this purpose, or suggest an alternative secure approach if needed?

Thank you!
